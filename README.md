**Tableaux** is just a fancy french word for "images". And really that's all there is to it. Nothing but images (of cows for example). 
I just used Pixabay's API to fetch the images and display it in a nice looking grid, gave it some basic functionality. 
Quite simple but I was interested in writing good code with React and Redux rather than making new Instagram.
